Description: This package provides a direct implementation of the PASS and PASSC methods proposed in Optimal Subsampling via Predictive Inference (2023), which are used for subsampling among an unlabeled data set for individuals potentially of interest based on information from the unlabeled data set together with a labeled data set.
    The package also contains some auxilary functions for computing the estimated quantities used in the whole algorithm.
